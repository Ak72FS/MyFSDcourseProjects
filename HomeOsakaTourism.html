                    <p>Osaka (大阪, Ōsaka) is Japan's second largest metropolitan area after Tokyo. It has been the economic powerhouse of the Kansai Region for many centuries. Osaka was formerly known as Naniwa. Before the Nara Period, when the capital used to be moved with the reign of each new emperor, Naniwa was once Japan's capital city, the first one ever known.Osaka is a major financial center of Japan, and it is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in Japan. The city is home to the Osaka Exchange as well as the headquarters of multinational electronics corporations such as Panasonic and Sharp. Osaka is an international center of research and development and is represented by several major universities, notably Osaka University, Osaka Metropolitan University, and Kansai University. Famous landmarks in the city include Osaka Castle, Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan, Dōtonbori, Tsūtenkaku in Shinsekai, Tennōji Park, Abeno Harukas, Sumiyoshi Taisha Grand Shrine, and Shitennō-ji, one of the oldest Buddhist temples in Japan.</p>
                    <h2>Osaka's History</h2>
                    <P>The first-ever sign of habitation or human life in the area around Osaka was found as the buried skeletons that are from far in the past dating to some 5th to 6th century. It was the Yayoi period when the city of Osaka when the increment in the population was observed. Not only that, the farming of rice grew, and port became one of the centers for trade. Due to the huge amount of tombs, the scientists and researchers mapped the conclusion that included the city as a center for political actions. The Naniwa Nagara-Toyosaki Palace was built in 645 by the emperor Kotoku by making Naniwa (present-day Osaka) the new capital of Japan. However, in a short span of time, another city was declared as the capital of Japan. Nonetheless, Naniwa sustained being a focus and bridge for trade with the nearby countries and prefectures.</P>
                    <p>In the year 1496, one of the Buddhist sects established its headquarters in one of the strong temples known as the Ishiyama Hongan-Ji. To drive the sect out of the temple, the government planned and set up a siege that lasted for around ten years that resulted in the destruction of the temple. Rather than rebuilding the Ishiyama Hongan-Ji temple, the very popular Osaka Castle was built in its place. All through time, Osaka grew out to become a center of economy and a well-known major city of Japan. Other than being a developing city in regards to trade and economy, it as well worked towards creating rich art culture by introducing the Kabuki theaters and ukiyo-e pictures. For example, in 1837, Oshio Heihachiro, a samurai, took over a revolt against the government that denied helping the poor families. It was massively supported by the locals. The rebellion was violently put down, and Oshio Heihachiro ended up suiciding.In 1888 later, Osaka opened its doors for trade and exchange purposes with the foreign that maximized the population along with the area.</p>
                    <p>The expansion of Osaka continued during the 19th century. Osaka has a promising situation due to which it observed the high number of Korean immigrants. The city consistently developed at a rapid pace making it through the most modern cities in Japan due to the strong politics that pulled the economy and industrialization in the right direction.During world war 2, Osaka had to undergo massive destruction as the American air raid hit the city multiple times, making sure to affect the urban areas.</p>
